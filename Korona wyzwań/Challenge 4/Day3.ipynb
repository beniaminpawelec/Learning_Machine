      "0 b\"Oct 12 2009 \\tNice trendy hotel location not too bad.\\tI stayed in this hotel for one night. As this is a fairly new place some of the taxi drivers did not know where it was and/or did not want to drive there. Once I have eventually arrived at the hotel, I was very pleasantly surprised with the decor of the lobby/ground floor area. It was very stylish and modern. I found the reception's staff geeting me with 'Aloha' a bit out of place, but I guess they are briefed to say that to keep up the coroporate image.As I have a Starwood Preferred Guest member, I was given a small gift upon-check in. It was only a couple of fridge magnets in a gift box, but nevertheless a nice gesture.My room was nice and roomy, there are tea and coffee facilities in each room and you get two complimentary bottles of water plus some toiletries by 'bliss'.The location is not great. It is at the last metro stop and you then need to take a taxi, but if you are not planning on going to see the historic sites in Beijing, then you will be ok.I chose to have some breakfast in the hotel, which was really tasty and there was a good selection of dishes. There are a couple of computers to use in the communal area, as well as a pool table. There is also a small swimming pool and a gym area.I would definitely stay in this hotel again, but only if I did not plan to travel to central Beijing, as it can take a long time. The location is ok if you plan to do a lot of shopping, as there is a big shopping centre just few minutes away from the hotel and there are plenty of eating options around, including restaurants that serve a dog meat!\\t\\r\\n\"\n",

       "b\"Aug 4 2009 \\tExcellent value - location not a big problem.\\tWe stayed at the Aloft Beijing Haidian for 5 nights from July 17 - 22nd. There are lots of reviews that talk about the location being a problem but we knew this ahead of time and found that it really wasn't an issue. The longest we spent in a taxi was about 30 minutes. We never paid more than 50rmb for a taxi ride (which is about $8 Cdn) and that was to the Forbidden City. Given there are 4 in our family, it was no big deal at all.As for the rooms, they were clean, the beds comfortable, the wireless internet connection reliable and it was one of the few hotels we found in Beijing that would accomodate 2 adults and 2 children. We paid about $70 Cdn. per night. That's an amazing price.It's not meant to be a 5 star hotel so you can't go in expecting that. We found the reception staff generally very helpful and friendly. They aren't the fastest in the world but it wasn't unreasonable at all.The hotel manager made an effort to speak with us a few times and was extremely helpful and welcoming. Their breakfast buffet was quite good and reasonably priced. There are a number of good restaurants in the Four Points Sheraton next door so there were lots of options. There is a massive mall about a block away that has other dining options as well.The only issue we ran into was a few taxi drivers refusing to take us to the Summer Palace because I guess they felt it wasn't far enough. The minimum rate is 10rmb. But the staff at the Four Points Sheraton (which is on a busier road than the side street for Aloft) were quite helpful in finding taxis for us if they weren't already there.We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends for its excellent value.\\t\\r\\n\""
